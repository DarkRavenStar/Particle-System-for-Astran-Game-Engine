# Particle-System-for-Astran-Game-Engine
Particle system developed as a subsystem for the Astran Game Engine and was also one of the assignment for my game engine subject. It features:

4 types of 2D Shape mode (Square, Circle, Stripes, Triangle) and Random between 4 shapes
5 types of Affector  (Gravity, Speed, Scaling, Color and Rotation)  to modify the particle system behaviours
4 types of emitter shape (Point, Square, Circle, Ring) - It modifies the radius shape of the particle spawning
Property Panel to edit and modify the particle system, 5 affectors, 3 emittor shapes and other setting.
